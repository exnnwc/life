# life
So this is my implementatio of Life. I read on Stack Exchange that this should be something a programmer should be able to do so I'm trying to do it. I tried to make it completely PHP with no Javascript but I can't figure out a simple way to implement displaying the iterations that are required by Life in a completely clean way.
